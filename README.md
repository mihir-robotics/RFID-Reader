# RFID Reader Project

**Date Created:** September 2021

This repository contains the software and documentation for an RFID card reader project. The primary goal was to develop software that interfaced with an RFID reader module and displayed RFID card data on a 16x2 LCD screen using the C8051F340 microcontroller.

## Project Overview

The project focuses on interfacing an RFID reader module with the C8051F340 microcontroller and displaying the read RFID card data on a 16x2 LCD screen. The software implementation facilitates the communication between the microcontroller, RFID reader, and the LCD screen to achieve this functionality.

## Repository Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code files for the RFID reader software implementation.
- `docs/`: Includes documentation, datasheets, or relevant resources related to the RFID reader module and LCD screen.
- `hardware/`: Contains hardware-related documentation etc.

## Features

- **RFID Card Reading:** Interface with an RFID reader module to read RFID card data.
- **LCD Display:** Show the read RFID card data on a 16x2 LCD screen.
- **Microcontroller Integration:** Software developed specifically for the C8051F340 microcontroller.
